    <h1>Birth and Abandonment</h1>
    <p>Rhea Silvia was not allowed to have any children, but she secretly gave birth to twinsâ€”Romulus and Remus.</p>
    <p>Her uncle, Amulius, worried that the children would challenge his rule.</p>
    <p>He ordered for them to be thrown into the Tiber River to die.</p>

    <h1>Childhood and Upbringing</h1>
    <p>When they were to be put into the river, the servant secretly placed them in a basket, which floated down the river to the base of the Palatine Hill.</p>
    <p>A female wolf found them and cared for them instead of eating them.</p>
    <p>They were eventually found by a shepherd and his wife, who raised them as their own children.</p>

    <h1>Restoration and Founding of Rome</h1>
    <p>Romulus and Remus discovered their royal lineage and led a rebellion to overthrow King Amulius, restoring their grandfather, Numitor, to the throne.</p>
    <p>Rather than taking the throne themselves, they decided to found a new city in the place where they had been rescued.</p>
    <p>The brothers got into a fight deciding which hill to build it on.</p>
    <p>Romulus chose the Palatine Hill, while Remus wanted to use the Aventine Hill.</p>
    <p>To settle the fight, they decided to ask the gods, who supposedly sent birds to indicate their choice.</p>
    <p>Remus claimed to see six birds, but Romulus saw twelve, leading Romulus to declare that he was the one chosen to create and rule the new city.</p>
    <p>Another fight broke out, and Romulus killed his brother Remus.</p>
    <p>With Remus dead, Romulus founded the city on the Palatine Hill, naming it Rome after himself.</p>

    <h1>The Legacy of the Story</h1>
    <p>The image of the wolf caring for the twins became a powerful symbol of Rome.</p>
    <p>The story was told to explain the city's origins, its strength, and the need for its protection.</p>
